This folder contains models of Salle Bauzil specifically made
to create Octomaps (i.e., all parts are solid and watertight).
The Makefile also creates 2D maps for navigation by cutting a
slice between 0.05 and 0.15 m above the ground and projecting
it to the ground.

ATTENTION: The global scale of the models may be incorrect,
therefore check the dimensions before using the models.

To build the octomaps:
  1. Install xsltproc
  2. Install the Octomap and map_server ROS packages
  3. Download binvox from http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~min/binvox/
     and edit the corresponding path in the Makefile
  4. Export the Blender scene to "X3D Extensible 3D". Make sure to set the axes
     "Forward" to "X Forward" and "Up" to "Z Up".
  5. Start a roscore
  6. make
